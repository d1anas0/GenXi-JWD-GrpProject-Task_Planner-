    - adjusted validation feedback text
    - adjusted validation feedback test parameters for other fields to be inline with task requirements
Changes to Javascript:
    - added validation feature to team member (ie. id="form-validate-assignee")
    ***added validation code for DUE DATE (DATEPICKER) but code is not complete, does not work. 
Verification activities completed: 
    - validation features for Task Name, Assigned to, Description of Task - OK
    - validation feature for due date: defaulted to 'invalid' - NEED TO FIX CODE TO MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL IN RESPONSE TO THE CORRECT SELECTION BEING MADE (IE. DATE IN THE FUTURE IS SELECTED).
