# Task Planner

This was a group project @Vasiliygenadiy, @MartinK114 and I worked on together as one of the assessment tasks in our coding intensive course.

Have a play here:

You can set tasks for people in your team, and each team member can manage their own task list using the filter function. 
Task progress can be tracked and I'd also added a feature to review a task before it is marked as complete (and therefore taken off the task list).  

**Try it out, and let me know your thoughts via #Discussions here on GitHub. :smile:**

Ideas and Features I will look to implement: 
- add a completed tasks page to keep record of all tasks
- add a comments field when updating task status, especially when closing out a task

Anything you'd like to add?
