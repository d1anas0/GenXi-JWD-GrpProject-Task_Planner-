# Task Planner

This was a group project @Vasiliygenadiy, @MartinK114 and I worked on together as one of the assessment tasks in our coding intensive course. 

**Try it out, and let me know your thoughts. If you have any suggestions or would like to collaborate on this, please feel free. There are many directions this could go :smile:**

Ideas so far: 
- add a completed tasks page to keep record of all tasks
- add a comments field when updating task status, especially when closing out a task
